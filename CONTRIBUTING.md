## How to Contribute (Your First Pull Request!)

Contributing to this list is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the `awesome-python` repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Get a local copy of your forked repository on your machine:
    ```bash
    git clone "https://github.com/MaverickPoly/awesome-python.git"
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch:** Create a dedicated branch for your contribution. This keeps your changes organized:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b add-my-awesome-item
    ```
    Choose a descriptive name for your branch, like `add-fastapi-extension` or `fix-broken-link`.
4.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Open the `README.md` file.
    * **Add your suggested item(s)** to the most appropriate category.
    * **Maintain alphabetical order** within each category. This makes the list easy to navigate.
    * If you believe a new category is needed, please suggest it in your pull request description.
    * **Format your entry** like this:
        `* [**ResourceName**](https://example.com/): A concise, 1-2 sentence description explaining what the resource is and why it's awesome or useful.`
5.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add [Resource Name] to [Category Name]"
    ```
    (Using `feat:` for new features/additions, or `fix:` for fixes, helps maintain clear commit history.)
6.  **Push to Your Fork:** Upload your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin add-my-awesome-item
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    * GitHub will usually prompt you to "Compare & pull request" from your new branch to the `main` branch of the original `awesome-python` repo.
    * Provide a clear title and description for your PR, explaining what you added or changed and why it's a valuable contribution.
